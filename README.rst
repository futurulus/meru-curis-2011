meru-curis-2011

William Monroe (futurulus)

This repository contains all of my working files for Meru: Building a Virtual
City, part of the 2011 CURIS summer research program at Stanford University.
It consists mainly of four types of files:

* Source
    Scripts to run in the Sirikata virtual world platform, the subject of the
    summer's research.  Scripts are mostly in Emerson (\*.em), a superset of
    JavaScript than can be read by the Sirikata client (object host).  The
    occasional source file describing a user interface is written in pure
    JavaScript (\*.js).

* Meshes
    Final meshes for Sirikata are in the COLLADA interchange format (\*.dae);
    working project files are in various other 3D model formats, most commonly
    Google SketchUp (\*.skp) and Blender (\*.blend).

* Images and other media
    Includes screenshots, screencasts, and images used to texture models.

* Text documentation and notes
    My own notes, copies of tutorials I've written for the wiki (in MediaWiki
    markup -- see http://sirikata.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Wmonroe4), the
    first draft and final draft of my research poster, and other information in
    textual form.

The files in this repository are very much drafts; they are not guaranteed to
be correct, and even those which are correct now (25 Aug 2011) will almost
certainly become outdated very quickly.

While I hope the Emerson scripts in particular will be useful as examples, the
usual disclaimer applies: the files in this repository come with NO WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, to the extent permitted by law.  See the file COPYING for details
about licensing.
